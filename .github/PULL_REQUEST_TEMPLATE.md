Congratulations for finishing the exercises! (I hope)


The way PRs work in Whalen's Advanced CS is members of a team submit PRs to merge their changes to the main branch.

Branches allow different members to work on the same code base at the same time without affect each other's work.
The main branch is the branch that all other branches feed into and pull out of.

Once a PR is submitted, the team manager will review your code and determine if you did a good enough job.
If you did a subpar job, changes will be requested and you'll need to fix your code.
