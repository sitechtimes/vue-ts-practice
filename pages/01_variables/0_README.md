# Variables

**_"Variables are what make the world go round."_**
-Sun Tzu, _The Art of War_

Starting now, in all future sections, each `// TODO: ` comment must be completed in your final PR.

Some files may have tests associated with them, denoted by their `.test.ts` variants. You are allowed to look at these.

To run these tests yourself, open a new terminal (without closing your current one) and run the following command:

```sh
npm run test pages/01_variables/<fileName>.test.ts
```

For example, to run the tests for `variables1.vue`, run

```sh
npm run test pages/01_variables/variables1.test.ts
```
