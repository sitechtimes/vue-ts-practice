TODO: create a page with a BMI calculator.

* It should have inputs, but no "calculate" button; the BMI should be calculated whenever an input changes.

* ONLY when the screen's width is exactly 1420px, the BMI should be changed so that it is always 6.9, no matter what the inputs are.
? When the screen's width is not exactly 1420px, the BMI calculator should return to normal functionality.

* When the BMI is greater than or equal to 30, show an image of fat chungus that covers the entire screen.
? The image is already in the public folder; use "/fatchungus.png" as your image source.

* Whenever the BMI is changed, there should be a 0.001% chance to redirect the user to the "/" page.

! The entire page should be inside a single parent div.
* Add a "nuke" button that, when clicked, DELETES all the elements inside the parent div, not just unrenders them via v-if.

* Add an "on/off" button. When "off", the BMI should never change.
