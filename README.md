# Vue + TypeScript Exercises

This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading, writing, and debugging Vue + TypeScript code.

It is recommended you go through the entire project without relying too heavily on AI ðŸ˜Š

## Getting Started

### Fork the Repository

Before you do anything, fork this repository to create a copy of it on your own profile.

### Clone the Repository

Now that you have your own copy, clone the repository to your machine. If you don't know how at this point you're cooked ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

### Install Recommended Extensions

If you haven't already, install all of the recommended extensions in this repository.

If you missed the popup, use the `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions` VSCode command to review the list.

### Install Dependencies

The following command will install all require dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Only top 0.0001% of developers know the variants... </strong>(<em>Click to expand</em>)</summary>

```sh
npm isntall
```

and

```sh
npm i
```

</details>

### Run the Development Server

The following command will run the local development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Every time you save a file, this development server will automatically update with your latest changes.

Open the development server (typically on `localhost:3000`), and use the navigation buttons to navigate between exercises.

### Extra Information

Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and run `>Developer: Reload Window` to clear any unintentional errors.

This project is set up with Nuxt, which allows us to, among other things, use imports without writing `import ... from "..."` for each import. If you encounter any errors regarding standard Vue imports (`onMounted`, `ref`, `watch`, etc), try rerunning the development server and reloading your window.

Another thing to note about Nuxt: if you make any crazy changes, the development server will brick and you will encounter a big bad gween ewwow page with big bad scawy ewwows. To fix this, rerun the development server.

### FINAL: Submit a Pull Request

Once you are done with all of the exercises, you will submit a Pull Request (PR). This is the equivalent of submitting an assignment on Google Classroom.

However, if there are any problems with your code, you will be requested to change it. This is how the Advanced class works - it's a very tough and hard and **extremely serious** class!

## Doing Exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `pages/<topic>`. For every topic, there is an additional `README.md` file with some resources to get you started on the topic.

I highly recommend that you have a look at them before you start!

Most exercises contain a mistake (or multiple) that causes an error, and it's up to you to fix it! **Some exercises contain tests** _(which can be found in respective `pages/<topic>.test.ts` files)_ **that need to pass for the exercise to be done!**

:warning: **Please avoid looking at any function or component code outside of the `pages/<topic>` or `pages/<topic>.test.ts` files.** If a function is not explictly written in the file, it's intentional!

Look for `// TODO: ` comments for hints on what you need to change. They will be highlighted orange if you installed the recommended extensions.

<details>
<summary><strong>If orange TODO comments aren't being shown... </strong>(<em>Click to expand</em>)</summary>

Look for this extension on the VSCode extension marketplace: `edwinhuish.better-comments-next`

</details>

If you still need more hints, each page on the development server has a button that expands into up to 3 hints, with each preceding hint revealing more and more of the solution.

Don't feel ashamed for needing hints! As long as you understand the code, consider the exercise a success ðŸŽ‰

## Continuing On

Once you've completed these exercises, put your new knowledge to good use! Continue practicing your TypeScript skills by building your own projects, and stuff!
